MacOS High Sierra Media Key Enabler for iTunes

It only works with physical buttons, won't work with touchbar.

Download the compiled application from my [homepage](http://milgra.com/high-sierra-media-key-enabler.html)

I don't have a developer certificate so trust the app when MacOS asks. Compile the project yourself if you don't trust me :)
